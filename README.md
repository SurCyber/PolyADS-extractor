Polyglot files are files that conform to multiple file formats simultaneously to bypass traditional security mechanisms. These files can be validly parsed as a PDF, a ZIP, and even an executable, all at once. When embedded in NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS), polyglot files become nearly invisible to conventional antivirus engines and file system explorers.
I have added a sample to test.
